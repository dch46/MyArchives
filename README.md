## Welcome to MyArchives

In September 2021 I started my university life and undergraduate studies at Guangdong University of Technology. The first two weeks were filled with interviews and training, which made me feel it is necessary to archive some of my works, such as essays, resumes and even some homework. Even if most of them were not masterpieces, I still want to keep them on file for memorialization, so that in the future, when needed, such as an interview, I could have a handy "physical evidence".
